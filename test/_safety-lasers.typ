The laser module is a class 2 laser, which does not require any protective eyewear. However, to avoid injury, do not look directly into the laser beam or its reflections.

- All beams should be terminated at the edge of the table, and laboratory doors should be closed whenever a laser is in use.
- Do not place laser beams at eye level, or your eyes at the laser level.
- Carry out experiments on an optical table such that all laser beams travel horizontally.
- Remove unnecessary reflective items such as reflective jewelry (e.g., rings, watches, etc.) while working near the beam path.
- Be aware that lenses and other optical devices reflect a portion of the incident beam from the front or rear  surface.
- Blackout Materials can prevent direct or reflected light from leaving the setup area.
- Use beam shutters and attenuation filters to reduce the beam power.
