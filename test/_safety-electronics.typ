This experiment deals with voltages and currents that should be kept low enough to minimize hazards. The strength of injury depends on the amount of current flow, the voltages, the frequency, the way the current takes through the body and the kind of current (AC or DC). The best practice for your safety is to follow the lab instructions.\

_Basic safety precautions when using electric circuits:_\

-	Switch off the supply if you make changes to the experiment even when the voltage is low
-	Do not connect power to a circuit until the circuit is finished and carefully checked
-	Do not exceed the voltage and current of the power source specified in the lab script
-	If you smell anything burning, immediately disconnect the power 
-	Never connect an ammeter across a voltage source
-	When working around electronic circuits, remove any watch, jewellery or loose clothing
