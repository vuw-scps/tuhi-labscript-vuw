These lab experiments use low-power light sources, to minimise risks. However, even a 1mW laser pointer can be dangerous to the eye, and some basic precautions are required at all times. The risks associated with light sources depend on the power but also on the wavelength (broadband sources can for instance contain UV or Infrared radiation, even if we don't see it). The best practice for your safety is to follow the lab instructions. If you are not sure about the use and safety of the equipment and your own safety, ask a Demonstrator or Lecturer.\

_Basic safety precautions when using light sources:_\

-	the lamp housing may become hot during operation. Take care when moving these
- Do not stare straight at a halogen bulb, it may be blinding or uncomfortable
- Never look directly at a laser beam, even from across the room or after reflection
- Think of others: always place the light in the direction of the floor or a wall. Experiments with lasers are often enclosed in a "box" (curtains or cardboard)
- Wear protective glasses when needed, following instructions
