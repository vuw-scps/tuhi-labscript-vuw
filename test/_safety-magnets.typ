These experiments involve relatively low magnetic fields, and do not require particular precautions beside standard laboratory practice. The strong neodymium magnets are safe to use, as long as you handle them with care:

- accidents have occurred with children swallowing such magnets, which causes internal damage. Make sure you don't leave them lying around, and check that you haven't lost any on the floor or elsewhere.
- be very careful to avoid having two or more magnets jump against each other: they are brittle and the shock will often break them. It's also dangerous if you have a finger or skin in between (these magnets are relatively small, but it will still pinch quite hard).
