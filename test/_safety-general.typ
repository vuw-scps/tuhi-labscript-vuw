Whenever carrying out experimental work it is important to be aware of any dangers in your experiment or in the room around you.  Please take a moment when you enter the laboratory to familiarise yourself with the room and the other equipment around you. If you are not sure about the use and safety of the equipment and your own safety ask the Demonstrator and/or Lecturer.
